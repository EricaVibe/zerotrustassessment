Certificates, if not rotated regularly, can give an extended window for threat actors to attempt to extract and exploit those certificates, leading to unauthorized access. Credentials, when exposed, provide attackers with legitimate credentials to blend their activities with legitimate operations, making it easier to bypass security controls. If an attacker compromises an applicationâ€™s certificate, they can escalate their privileges within the system, leading to broader access and control, depending on the privileges of the application.

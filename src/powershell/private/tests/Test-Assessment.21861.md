Users who are considered high risk by Entra ID Protection have a very high probability of being compromised by threat actors. Threat actors can gain initial access via compromised valid accounts, where their suspicious activities continue despite having triggered risk indicators. This oversight can enable persistence as threat actors can manipulate activities that would normally warrant investigation, such as unusual login patterns or suspicious inbox rules. The lack of triage of risky users allows for expanded reconnaissance activities, with their anomalous behavior patterns continuing to generate uninvestigated alerts. Depending on the permissions and access of compromised accounts, threat actors can achieve lateral movement and , while defense evasion becomes simpler as security teams have demonstrated they're not actively responding to risk indicators.

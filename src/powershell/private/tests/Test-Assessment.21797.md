A high-risk user’s  should be assumed to be compromised by threat actors. Without preventative controls, threat actors can  execute scripts, deploy malicious applications, or manipulate API calls to establish persistence, based on the risky user’s permissions,. With elevated permissions, they exploit misconfigurations or abuse OAuth tokens to move laterally across cloud workloads such as documents, SaaS applications, or Azure Resources. Sensitive files, customer records, or proprietary code are accessed and exfiltrated to external repositories while maintaining stealth through legitimate cloud services. Finally, the threat actor may disrupt operations by modifying configurations, encrypting data for ransom, or leveraging stolen information for further attacks, resulting in financial, reputational, and regulatory consequences.

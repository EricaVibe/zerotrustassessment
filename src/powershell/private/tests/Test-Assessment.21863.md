Risky sign-ins flagged by Entra ID Protection indicate a higher probability of unauthorized access attempts. Threat actors leverage these sign-ins to gain an initial foothold. Without triage, these sign-ins remain uninvestigated, allowing adversaries to establish persistence by repeatedly authenticating under the guise of legitimate users. This lack of response enables attackers execute reconnaissance, attempt to escalate their access, while blending into normal authentication patterns. As untriaged sign-ins continue to generate alerts without intervention, security gaps widen, facilitating lateral movement and defense evasion, as adversaries recognize the absence of an active security response.
